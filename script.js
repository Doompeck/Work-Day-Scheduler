// Need to be able to declare the current time,
// declare needed html elements that will be needed:
// (the currentDay id, the container block that the timeblocks will load into, the jumbotron)

// will need to use moment to determine the current hour

// also use moment to declare the current day

// will need an array to map available hours

// For loop to render a block element for each hour of the day.
// This will include our template html that describes said block
// Will need an if statement in here that determines past, present, or future

// Will need an event listener for the container element
// This will be used to save the data for the clicked time's data into local storage.
